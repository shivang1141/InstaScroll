# Scroll Extension

I created this extension because I frequently use Instagram on my laptop, and scrolling through posts using the mouse can be tedious. This extension simplifies the browsing experience by providing convenient Up and Down arrow buttons for smoother navigation.


A simple Chrome extension that adds Up and Down arrow buttons to scroll the webpage. This extension is particularly useful when browsing websites like Instagram, where users often scroll through content.

## Features

- Click the Up arrow button to scroll up by 90% of the viewport height
- Click the Down arrow button to scroll down by 90% of the viewport height
- Works on most websites, with some limitations on Instagram Reels

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner of the Extensions page.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the Scroll Extension files.
5. The Scroll Extension should now be added to your Chrome browser, and you should see the extension icon in the toolbar.

## Usage

1. Click the Scroll Extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension popup.
2. Use the Up and Down arrow buttons to scroll up or down on the current webpage.

## Limitations

- The extension may not work as expected on some websites.
